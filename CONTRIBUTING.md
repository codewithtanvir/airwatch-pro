```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/airwatch-pro.git
cd airwatch-pro

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (see Setup Guide)

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install                    # Frontend and API dependencies

# 4. Start development servers
npm run dev                    # Frontend with Vite (port 5173)
vercel dev                     # API functions locally (port 3000)

# 5. Run tests
npm run test                   # Frontend tests

### 📝 Coding Standards

#### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

```typescript
// Use TypeScript for type safety
interface AirQualityData {
  location: Location;
  timestamp: Date;
  aqi: number;
  pollutants: PollutantLevels;
}

// Use descriptive component names
const AirQualityDashboard: React.FC<Props> = ({ location }) => {
  // Use custom hooks for logic
  const { data, loading, error } = useTEMPOData(location);
  
  // Early returns for error states
  if (error) return <ErrorBoundary error={error} />;
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  
  return (
    <div className="air-quality-dashboard">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Node.js API Functions (Vercel)

```javascript
// Use TypeScript for serverless functions
import type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';

interface AirQualityResponse {
  coordinates: { lat: number; lon: number };
  data: {
    aqi: number;
    level: string;
    pollutants: Record<string, number>;
    timestamp: string;
  };
}

// Use proper HTTP handlers
export default function handler(req: VercelRequest, res: VercelResponse) {
  // Set CORS headers
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  
  // Validate input
  const { lat, lon } = req.query;
  if (!lat || !lon) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing coordinates' });
  }
  
  try {
    // Process air quality data
    const data = calculateAirQuality(parseFloat(lat), parseFloat(lon));
    res.status(200).json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}

// Use descriptive function names and JSDoc
/**
 * Calculate air quality index for given coordinates
 * @param lat - Latitude coordinate
 * @param lon - Longitude coordinate
 * @returns Air quality data with AQI and pollutant levels
 */
function calculateAirQuality(lat: number, lon: number): AirQualityResponse {
  // Implementation
}
```

## üìñ Project Details

### **THE WHY**

#### The Global Crisis
Air pollution is a silent killer, contributing to **7 million deaths annually** according to WHO. With **99% of people worldwide breathing air that exceeds WHO pollution guidelines**, we face an unprecedented public health emergency. Vulnerable communities‚Äîchildren, elderly, and those with respiratory conditions‚Äîsuffer disproportionately from poor air quality.

#### The Data Gap
Traditional air quality monitoring relies on sparse ground-based sensors with limited coverage and reactive reporting. NASA's TEMPO satellite mission represents a breakthrough: **the first space-based instrument to monitor air pollution hourly across North America**. However, this revolutionary data remains largely inaccessible to communities that need it most.

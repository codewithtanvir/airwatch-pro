NASA INTERNATIONAL SPACE APPS CHALLENGE 2025 – BANGLADESH


Join the NASA International Space Apps Champions from Bangladesh, Team Olik, Team Mohakash, Team Diamonds, and Team Voyagers at the Global Stage at NASA Headquarters. You are NEXT!!


Cloud Camp Bangladesh, with the local organizers from 9 locations is organizing consecutively for the 13th time NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 during October 3, Friday and Saturday, October 4, 2025.
NASA is going to organize this event in 350+ Cities Globally. From Bangladesh 9 Cities (Dhaka, Sylhet, Chattogram, Barisal, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Cumilla) will be able to participate in this Global Hack-a-Thon. It will involve any and all university students in Bangladesh virtually, and nearly ten thousand students will be reached at this event. The 2025 NASA International Space Apps Challenge theme is “Learn, Launch, Lead.” At Space Apps, we strive to eliminate barriers of access to space and science opportunities. Space Apps is for anyone and everyone! Participants from around the world are welcomed regardless of background and experience to create, explore, learn, and build together. Through each year’s Space Apps Challenge, we continue to support and empower ideas through innovation and inclusion.
NASA Space Apps Challenge is an international mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over 48-hours in 350+ cities around the world. It is going to be organized from October 3rd and October 4th, 2025, simultaneously and virtually all over the world. Last year, in Bangladesh, we received more than 500 projects from 31 categories. Among them 50 teams were invited to participate at 48 hours global hackathon physically, and the rest joined virtually. It’s been a great pride and honor for us that, amongst 152 countries, 57,999 participants, 8,715 teams, and 5,556 projects from all over the world, TEAM VOYAGERS from Rajshahi was awarded GLOBAL champion for the Best Use of Storytelling category in 2023. In addition, Bangladesh obtained 3rd and 5th place in 2017; won the championship in 2018, 2021, and 2022; along with additional finalists in 2019 and 2020 from Bangladesh. We are on a roll and intent to continue to lead the world for this competition!!
All are welcome in Space Apps. The common thread among Space Apps participants is that you are interested in space science and exploration, you are creative, and you want to solve problems. Over 93,520 people in 15,444 teams from 163 countries and in 485 cities around the world participated and submitted 9,996 projects in the 2024 International Space Apps Challenge. 
If you can’t find a Space Apps event located near you, or you could not join in time for the local event, join the Virtual Event online, called UNIVERSAL Event, and do the Space Apps challenge from your home!
Space Apps builds connections. As a part of Space Apps, you are part of a global hack-a-thon community that embraces collaboration across borders, sectors, and cultures to bring about paradigm-shifting innovation.

THE PROCESS FOR THE NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE IN BANGLADESH
BEFORE THE HACK-A-THON DAY


1. Read all the problems in NASA Space Apps Challenge site 
Read the challenges https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/challenges/  in detail, and make sure you understand everything. Pick a category and challenge based on your skill level.
YOU MUST UTILIZE NASA’S OPEN DATA FOR YOUR WINNING SOLUTION: Check out all the data  and API availability here: 
NASA Open Data: https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/. 
NASA Open API: https://api.nasa.gov/
Utilize Python Library, pyNASA: https://github.com/bmtgoncalves/pyNASA Or https://github.com/NASA. 
You can use NASA data to even create a poster, build an application, utilize your hardware, create a video, and anything in between. If you do not know how to use NASA data and use of API, use the following videos to learn:
* You can learn how to use API using this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw 
* How to use NASA API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfXp_YEQRRI 
* NASA API solution Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfXp_YEQRRI&pp=ygUgaG93IHRvIHVzZSBuYXNhIGRhdGEgdGhyb3VnaCBhcGk%3D 




You must choose one challenge from 2025 challenges to be eligible for global award


2. Get your questions answered
Must join the WhatsApp and Slack Channels to get regular updates, ask for support and get news and announcements:
   1. Slack Channel: https://join.slack.com/t/spaceappsbd/shared_invite/zt-a9litut0-lS90oC2Xyy86SfEcwG9qtg 
   2. WhatsApp channel: https://chat.whatsapp.com/F2O4Y4U5upN0U7bP95uCKV 
 
3. Start by registration at Local site
Register with Local registration site  by September 1; this is a team based registration. You have to choose the name of the Team, and number of the team members (preferable number is 5), and contact information (Email Address and Mobile Number) for each of the participants. You need to choose a location - Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, Rangpur, Barisal, Mymensingh, Khulna, Cumilla or Rajshahi – your intended Hack-a-Thon location. Please write a short description of a problem, and create a YouTube Video. 
THIS ENSURES THAT YOU GET ALL NOTIFICATIONS AND UPDATES, AS WELL AS BEING JUDGED AT VIRTUAL PARTICIPATION FOR THE FINAL HACK-A-THON.


4. Register individually and the team at NASA site
Register with NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE based on your LOCATION you have selected in the step #1. 


STEP 1: SIGN UP FOR A SPACE APPS ACCOUNT: Sign up for a Space Apps account HERE (https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/create-account/). Once you input your information, you will be prompted to verify your email address.


STEP 2: REGISTER TO PARTICIPATE
Participant registration for Space Apps 2025 opens in mid-July and will remain open through the end of the hackathon on October 5, 2025 (11:59 p.m. local time).


To participate in the Space Apps Challenge, you must register for a Local Event or the Universal Event. We encourage you to complete this step at least one to two weeks before the hackathon to join the chat channels and form teams.


Log in to the website using your username and password
Click “Choose a Local Event” from the user dashboard (see “Dashboard” in your menu bar) OR register through one of the Local Event pages or Universal Event page. The location registration URL is https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/; search for the locations in either one of the following:
* Dhaka
* Chattogram
* Sylhet
* Barisal
* Cumilla
* Rangpur
* Rajshahi
* Khulna
* Mymensingh


EVERY INDIVIDUAL MUST REGISTER AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE APPS CHALLENGE SITE TO BE ELIGIBLE to PARTICIPATE PHYSICALLY FOR THE BANGLADESH EVENT.


The Space Apps Challenge features hundreds of Local Events allowing participants to find potential teammates located in the same community or time zone, or who speak the same language. Since one of the goals of Space Apps is to build local communities, we suggest that participants join a Local Event based on their physical location or their networks/connections to a particular location. If there are no Local Events in your area, you can register for the Universal Event.


You can change your Local Event at any time by selecting the "change" option next to your designated Local Event on your user dashboard.


Teams may consist of participants from one Local Event or from several Local Events. You may eventually choose to join a team that is tied to another Local Event because you like their project idea. Or you may choose to invite people from other Local Events to join your team because you need their skills. During Local Judging your project will be evaluated by the local judges at the Local Event for which your team is registered.


STEP 3: CONNECT WITH YOUR LOCAL LEAD (Local for Bangladesh)
Local Leads are the organizers of Space Apps Challenge Local Events. They are available to answer questions and help connect you to potential teammates prior to the hackathon. Local Leads are the primary points of contact for your Local Event and will support your hackathon experience. They will also be available in the chat channels in the week leading up to the hackathon and during the hackathon. Please reach out to them as you prepare and for specific details regarding your Local Event!


5. Form your TEAM 
Build your team and optionally choose mentor(s). Make sure your team is fully prepared to and understood the problem thoroughly. They have completed UX design, created the prototype, and tested with data. You should be fully ready for the Hack-a-Thon!!
Please use this link for the instructions for the Team. (https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/resources/team-formation-guide/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=team-formation-guide&fbclid=IwY2xjawE9KAZleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHduvIlxcU9ngf4J2YdN7vx9KDblz_QnIbC8rJBpUHbNetvmL_avrluFGBA_aem_2d21c_iLdpOHOlkkgt7Ueg) 
Introduction to Team Formation
To create or join a team, you will first need to:
1. Create a NASA Space Apps account.
2. Register for the 2025 NASA International Space Apps Challenge.
3. Choose a Local Event.
While you may be on a team by yourself, we highly recommend that you work with other participants:

NASA Space Apps Challenges for 2025


Name of the Problem
	Description
	Background
	Your Challenge
	Animation Celebration of Terra Data!
	NASA’s oldest daily Earth-viewing satellite – Terra – just turned 25 years old, and with five continuously operating instruments onboard (most taking imagery at the same time), Terra has piled up a LOT of data over the years (over 9,000 days and counting!).
	This data has the potential to shed light on everything from scientific processes to unique events, all while helping solve problems that affect humans.
	Your challenge is to use data from any or all of Terra’s five instruments to create an animated product showcasing an Earth science story and emphasizing the impacts to you, your community, and/or the environment.
	A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI
	Data from several different space-based exoplanet surveying missions have enabled discovery of thousands of new planets outside our solar system, but most of these exoplanets were identified manually.
	With advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), it is possible to automatically analyze large sets of data collected by these missions to identify exoplanets.
	Your challenge is to create an AI/ML model that is trained on one or more of the open-source exoplanet datasets offered by NASA and that can analyze new data to accurately identify exoplanets.
	BloomWatch: An Earth Observation Application for Global Flowering Phenology
	Witness the pulse of life across our planet! From season to season and year to year, Earth’s vegetation is constantly changing, providing critical information on plant species, crops, seasonal effects, pollen sources, and changes in plant phenology (the relationship between seasonal changes and climate and biological phenomena in plants).
	—
	Your challenge is to harness the power of NASA Earth observations to create a dynamic visual tool that displays and/or detects plant blooming events around the globe—just like pollinators do–and that advances solutions for monitoring, predicting, or managing vegetation.
	Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine
	Enable a new era of human space exploration! NASA has been performing biology experiments in space for decades, generating a tremendous amount of information that will need to be considered as humans prepare to revisit the Moon and explore Mars.
	Although this knowledge is publicly available, it can be difficult for potential users to find information that pertains to their specific interests.
	Your challenge is to build a dynamic dashboard that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge graphs, and/or other tools to summarize a set of NASA bioscience publications and enables users to explore the impacts and results of the experiments these publications describe.
	Commercializing Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
	As the commercialization of space rapidly accelerates, the future of business in low Earth orbit (LEO) holds incredible potential, but also presents significant operational, regulatory, and environmental challenges.
	This new economic frontier invites innovative and sustainable approaches to foster long-term viability and responsible execution.
	Your challenge is to conceptualize and design a scalable, sustainable, business model, accompanied by a prototype, that explores the unique opportunities LEO offers while addressing the complexities of operating in space.
	Create Your Own Challenge
	Participants are invited to create their own challenge to tackle during the hackathon.
	However, please note that while some Local Events may offer awards for "Create Your Own Challenge" projects, this challenge is not eligible for Global Judging and projects do not qualify for Global Awards.
	—
	Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements
	Climate change brings about new complexities to consider for maintaining the wellbeing of society and the environment in cities.
	Natural resources, ecosystems, and existing infrastructure all must be monitored to ensure human quality of life remains high.
	Your challenge is to demonstrate how an urban planner can use NASA Earth observation data to develop smart strategies for city growth that maintain both the wellbeing of people and the environment.
	Deep Dive: Immersive Data Stories from Ocean to Sky
	Satellite observations reveal insights about our dynamic home planet to scientists, but people without a remote sensing background often find the stories within these datasets difficult to access.
	NASA’s open data policy makes these observations available to everyone—scientists and non-scientists alike.
	Your challenge is to build a short, immersive, virtual reality (VR) experience that leverages NASA’s Earth observation datasets and visualizations to bring stories about our planet’s oceans to life, connecting a broad audience to this data, its beauty, and its impact.
	Embiggen Your Eyes!
	While your cell phone screen can display about three million pixels of information and your eye can receive more than ten million pixels, NASA images from space are even bigger!
	NASA’s space missions continue to push the boundaries of what is technologically possible, providing high-resolution images and videos of Earth, other planets, and space with billions or even trillions of pixels.
	Your challenge is to create a platform that allows users to zoom in and out on these massive image datasets, label known features, and discover new patterns.
	From EarthData to Action: Cloud Computing with Earth Observation Data for Predicting Cleaner, Safer Skies
	NASA’s Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) mission is revolutionizing air quality monitoring across North America by enabling better forecasts and reducing pollutant exposure.
	—
	Your challenge is to develop a web-based app that forecasts air quality by integrating real-time TEMPO data with ground-based air quality measurements and weather data, notifying users of poor air quality, and helping to improve public health decisions.
	International Space Station 25th Anniversary Apps
	Crews onboard the International Space Station have many unique opportunities! They witness breathtaking Earth views from the station’s cupola—known as “the window to the world.” They also experience weightlessness and go outside the station on spacewalks, for which they must train extensively in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) at the Sonny Carter Training Facility in Houston, Texas.
	—
	Your challenge is to create a visual tool that not only helps students and the public understand two of the most prominent sensory experiences on the station (sight and weightlessness) through the lens of the cupola and the NBL, but also informs them how these unique experiences benefit humans on Earth.
	Meteor Madness
	A newly identified near-Earth asteroid, "Impactor-2025," poses a potential threat to Earth, but do we have the tools to enable the public and decision makers to understand and mitigate its risks?
	NASA datasets include information about known asteroids and the United States Geological Survey provides critical information that could enable modeling the effects of asteroid impacts, but these data need to be integrated to enable effective visualization and decision making.
	Your challenge is to develop an interactive visualization and simulation tool that uses real data to help users model asteroid impact scenarios, predict consequences, and evaluate potential mitigation strategies.
	NASA Farm Navigators: Using NASA Data Exploration in Agriculture
	The agriculture community faces the challenge of integrating technology and data to enhance sustainable farming practices.
	Simulating key farming activities like fertilizing, irrigating, and livestock management using real-world NASA satellite imagery and climate data can enable better understanding of the impacts of these variables on crop production.
	Your challenge is to create an engaging educational game that effectively utilizes NASA’s open data sets to simulate farming scenarios and enables players to learn how this data can inform innovative, sustainable, agricultural methods.
	Sharks from Space
	Earth’s ocean is one of the most powerful habitats in our universe, supporting a range of life that sustains ecosystems and habitability across the globe.
	It is common to measure photosynthetic activity in the ocean from space, but far more challenging to track top predators.
	Your challenge is to create a mathematical framework for identifying sharks and predicting their foraging habitats using NASA satellite data, and also to suggest a new conceptual model of a tag that could measure not only where sharks are, but what they are eating, and in real time transmit that data back to users to enable development of predictive models.
	SpaceTrash Hack: Revolutionizing Recycling on Mars
	During a hypothetical three-year mission to Mars and back, an eight-person crew would accumulate 12,600 kg of inorganic waste, or trash, including various packaging materials, textiles, and structural materials.
	This scenario creates a pressing need to recycle available materials, rather than execute the expensive and inefficient processes of transporting additional resources from Earth and/or sending trash back to Earth.
	Your challenge is to design sustainable systems that could manage, reuse, or recycle inorganic waste (“trash”) that is brought to and/or accumulated on the surface of Mars.
	Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings
	Although the Sun is 93 million miles away from our planet, solar activity can significantly impact our daily lives.
	“Space weather”—the variations that occur in the space environment between the Sun and Earth—can impact technologies in space and on Earth.
	Your challenge is to write and illustrate a digital children’s story that explains what space weather is and the varying impacts it has on different people such as farmers, pilots, astronauts, power grid operators, and the general public.
	Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR
	Like Alice in Wonderland, let’s travel down the rabbit hole… to reveal a world that looks like our planet Earth… but not quite!
	Using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), we can image the world by emitting radar pulses toward Earth and recording the energy that is reflected back after the signals interact with Earth's surface.
	Your challenge is to download multi-frequency or multi-polarization SAR data for an interesting study area of your choice –e.g., your hometown, a tropical wetland, ice sheet, forest wildfire, flooded neighborhood, volcano eruption, etc.—and use that data to develop hypotheses about the physical drivers operating there.
	Tides of Fire: Exploring the Planetary Forces Behind Solar Flares
	Solar flares and solar storms can wreak havoc on power grids, satellites, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and communications, yet predicting them remains a major scientific challenge.
	Emerging research hints at a surprising connection: the gravitational pull of planets may influence solar activity, much like the Moon drives tides on Earth.
	Your challenge is to dive into decades of solar flare data and apply your skills in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to explore whether the gravitational influence of planets can help predict major solar flare events, and to develop an innovative tool for forecasting space weather.
	Will It Rain On My Parade?
	If you’re planning an outdoor event—like a vacation, or a hike on a trail, or fishing on a lake—it would be good to know the chances of adverse weather for the time and location you are considering.
	There are many types of Earth observation data that can provide information on weather conditions for a particular location and day of the year.
	Your challenge is to construct an app with a personalized interface that enables users to conduct a customized query to tell them the likelihood of “very hot,” “very cold,” “very windy,” “very wet,” or “very uncomfortable” conditions for the location and time they specify.
	Your Home in Space: The Habitat Layout Creator
	Space habitats are “homes in space” that keep crew members healthy and able to execute their mission.
	Whether located on a planetary surface or in space, habitats must support critical functions such as waste management, thermal control, life support, communications, power, stowage, food storage and preparation, medical care, sleep, and exercise. Space habitat concepts can involve a diverse array of materials, geometries, and layouts.
	Your challenge is to create a visual tool that enables users to define a space habitat’s shape/volume and explore possible layout options.

AWARDS - Each of the Locations would have awards based on number of teams finally submitted their projects, based on the judging criteria set forth here in the document. Typically there are 2 awards for local winners. LOCAL JUDGING IS FINAL AND DISCRETIONY BY THE GROUP OF JUDGES SELECTED FOR EACH LOCAL ORGANIZATION.


                                          2. (Optional) ONE AWARD – From each location for Open NASA’s Innovation Space/People’s Choice Award: This reflects: One award which has not been awarded for other categories, but has very creative use of NASA’s Open Data or very inspirational. This is a potential award, and there might not be any, if not selected by the judges.


                                          3. LOCAL NOMINATION FOR GLOBAL JUDGING - Each location will independently nominate 1 team per 10 projects submitted in the project submission page as of the final submission time. This will be determined in a closed door, and the submission is final and acceptance by NASA team can not be challenged. Any team challenges this decision will automatically be rejected from global nomination.
                                          7. Global Judging for Global Finalists and Global Winners
Upto TWO projects get nominated for Global Judging from each location for first 20 entries, and then potentially one for every additional 10 entries: We may have two projects to be showcased on open NASA's Innovation Space. This site salutes the incredible work citizens create with NASA's open data. The Innovation Space nominations should be projects you did not submit for global awards but still want to recognize. The review process for the Innovation Space will occur after global awards are determined.


The NASA team will review nominations from Hosts across the universe to select finalists and winners within each category. During our judging process, you'll keep your community informed and engaged across email, your event page and social media. Together, we'll all celebrate the reveal of this year's biggest impacts!

Local selection for physical participation
First phase of the Bangaldesh allows you to be selected to participate in person at the mainstage. To be selcted, you have to submit a video, using the 240 seconds of glory format. This is a preliminary video and we understand you might not have all the information.


Local Awards
Local judging and awards occur under the direction of the Local Leads at each Space Apps location. Leads may then nominate based on number of projects submitted (typically 1 per 10 final submissions)  from each location to compete in the global judging process.


Global Awards
The brightest ideas across the Space Apps universe receive global recognition. Global award winners are featured on the Space Apps website and receive an invitation to visit NASA’s Goddard Space Center (or other location) with the Space Apps Global Organizing Team.
*Winner(s)  will be responsible for their personal travel, meals and incidental expenses, and accommodation expenses.


GLOBAL JUDGING PROCESS
Each location Lead may nominate up to two finalists from their location for global judging by NASA; nominations are due by 11:59pm EST, October 6st , 2025. Teams nominated for global judging will be asked to create a 30-second video about their project using effective storytelling techniques (see 30 Seconds of Glory graphic). Teams will submit videos by 12:00 PM local time on October 6st, 2025, by embedding a link to their video in their project page.


NASA experts will then review these nominations to select the top 30 projects. NASA experts will choose the global winners based on information from their project pages.

HOW TO CRAFT A WINNING PRESENTATION
While many Space Apps teams consider the first four criteria carefully and excel at developing solutions with great potential, the best of these teams pay equal attention to the final criterion, presentation. After all, how can your solution make a difference if you can’t effectively present and explain your solution in a way that will convince people to implement it?


We recommend devoting enough time and thought to developing your Space Apps presentation and building a great story around your project. Be sure to recruit team members with expertise in storytelling, design, and other means to capture your project and share the value of your solution. We have some ideas to help you! Please refer to the 240-Seconds of Glory guide for local judging and 30-Seconds of Glory for Global Judging.
________________
240 SECONDS OF GLORY FOR LOCAL JUDGING & Local Submission
For participants at Space Apps local events, your final project presentations for local judging of Space Apps will usually be limited to a four minutes each, using the 240 seconds of Glory. 


  



________________


30 SECONDS OF GLORY FOR GLOBAL JUDGING
Participants will make a 30-second video to present their challenge solution for global judging. This judges are comprised NASA Space Apps Challenge team, scientists, astronauts, and specially experienced judging members. This will determine if your project is in the final, as well as if that is a Global Winner. You don’t have to do anything after your project page has been submitted.




  







________________


INSTRUCTION FOR VIDEO UPLOAD
There are two videos you would have to upload. Any video uploaded after that time will not be considered for judging. The videos are:
                                                            1. 240 Seconds of Glory Video (4 minutes video for local judging & preliminary Local submission): This video will be used for local judging. You will be competing with the other teams from your local region. Maximum of two of the teams will be nominated and move to the global level. Email your 4 minutes video Link here: web@basis.org.bd.

MENTORING GUIDELINE
Who are the Mentors?
Mentors play a crucial role in the success of teams participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge. We extend our gratitude to the mentors who will dedicate significant time—8-10 hours pre-hackathon, and two full days on October 4 and 5 — to guide teams toward success. Their primary responsibility is to provide procedural clarity, listen to presentations, and answer any questions the teams might have. Mentors, however, will not assist in coding or building the solutions; the ideas and solutions must originate from the teams themselves. They can offer advice on tools, technologies, and processes, but the final decision rests with the teams.
Another important task for mentors is to ensure that teams complete all necessary steps, such as reading the participants guide, studying the challenge and resources using NASA data, documenting it, and submitting required materials like GitHub repositories and video presentations. Mentors will provide feedback on presentations and assist in selecting the top teams for the Bangladesh Main Stage. In short, mentors are there to ensure the process runs smoothly while safeguarding the integrity of the teams' original ideas and work.
Mentor Responsibilities
